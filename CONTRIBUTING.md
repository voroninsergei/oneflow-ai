# Contributing to OneFlow.AI

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document provides guidelines and instructions.

## Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/oneflow-ai.git
cd oneflow-ai
```

2. **Install development dependencies**
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

3. **Install pre-commit hooks**
```bash
pre-commit install
```

## Code Style and Quality

We use the following tools to maintain code quality:

### Ruff
- **Linting and formatting**: We use [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for fast Python linting
- Configuration: See `pyproject.toml` or `ruff.toml`
- Run linting: `ruff check .`
- Auto-fix issues: `ruff check --fix .`
- Format code: `ruff format .`

### Black
- **Code formatting**: [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) ensures consistent code style
- Line length: 100 characters (or as configured)
- Run formatting: `black .`
- Check formatting: `black --check .`

### Mypy
- **Type checking**: [Mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) performs static type analysis
- Run type checking: `mypy src/`
- Configuration: See `pyproject.toml` or `mypy.ini`
- Ensure all public functions have type hints

### Running All Checks
```bash
# Run all quality checks at once
ruff check . && black --check . && mypy src/
```

## Branching Strategy

We follow a simplified Git Flow model:

- **`main`** - Production-ready code, protected branch
- **`develop`** - Integration branch for features
- **`feature/*`** - New features (e.g., `feature/add-login`)
- **`bugfix/*`** - Bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix/fix-auth-error`)
- **`hotfix/*`** - Urgent production fixes
- **`release/*`** - Release preparation branches

### Creating a Branch
```bash
# For new features
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# For bug fixes
git checkout develop
git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description
```
